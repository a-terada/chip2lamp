# ChIP2LAMP

Discovery of combinatorial regulations is a key to understand complex gene regulation machineries. 
Combining this scripts (chip2lamp) with a statistical analysis [LAMP](seselab.org/lamp/) allows us to find statistically significant combinations by integrating ChIP-seqs and RNA-seqs. 
This can handle MACS1/2 result as a ChIP-seq peak caller and Cuffdiff result from RNA-seq.

Please see [http://seselab.org/chip2lamp/](http://seselab.org/chip2lamp/) for details.
